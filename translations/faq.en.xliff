If you have gone through installing the extension but AwardWallet keeps telling you that the extension is not installed you should verify two things:
<ol class="counter-list">
	<li>Make sure that the extension is actually enabled. Here are couple of screenshots that can help you do that:<br />

	<li>Make sure you fully restarted Internet Explorer <span class="bold">after</span> enabeling the extension. In most cases closing all the browser windows, but in some cases a computer reboot is required.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<br />
If these steps do not work you can try uninstalling the extension and installing it again from scratch. Here is how you uninstall the extension:<br />

The AwardWallet team only provides you with a technical platform &ndash; a way to manage your booking requests and to securely share your reward information with your agent. The booking team will actually do all the groundwork: they search for availability, they run different options by you (so they will communicate with you back and forth before any tickets are booked), they find the most optimal and least expensive routes, they do the actual bookings, and they handle the payments. They are the experts at doing reward bookings, they have done tens of thousands of bookings for their clients and they are very creative in finding availability. All of the communication about a booking request is done via AwardWallet website where you can manage your requests and communicate with your booking agent about your requests. So if you have a question related to a booking request please don&rsquo;t send it to AwardWallet support as we would not be able to help you, instead, you need to login to your account and respond to <a href="https://awardwallet.com/awardBooking/requests?archive=1">your existing booking request</a>&nbsp;or create a new booking request:<br />

        <source><![CDATA[Yes, you can enable two-factor authentication in your profile making your AwardWallet profile much more secure. At a high level it means you will use your phone (or an app of your choice, such as 1Password or LastPass) to generate a one-time code in addition to your username and password to login to AwardWallet. &nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t know what two-factor authentication is you can read the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication">Wiki article</a> or just <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?&amp;q=what+is+two+factor+authentication">Google it</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Setting up two-factor authentication is very easy; first, you need to download a Google Authenticator app (or similar), for your <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;hl=en">Android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8">iOS</a> or <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/apps/021dd79f-0598-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8">Windows Phone</a> device. Alternatively, you can use a password management tool such as 1Password to generate these one-time codes. Then you need to click &ldquo;<a href="https://awardwallet.com/user/edit.php">Setup</a>&rdquo; under the Two-factor Authentication heading in your <a href="https://awardwallet.com/user/edit.php">AwardWallet profile</a>. After that you will see a special QR code that needs to be scanned by the Google Authenticator app (or by the password management app) to set it up:<br />

        <target state="new"><![CDATA[Yes, you can enable two-factor authentication in your profile making your AwardWallet profile much more secure. At a high level it means you will use your phone (or an app of your choice, such as 1Password or LastPass) to generate a one-time code in addition to your username and password to login to AwardWallet. &nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t know what two-factor authentication is you can read the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication">Wiki article</a> or just <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?&amp;q=what+is+two+factor+authentication">Google it</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Setting up two-factor authentication is very easy; first, you need to download a Google Authenticator app (or similar), for your <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;hl=en">Android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8">iOS</a> or <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/apps/021dd79f-0598-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8">Windows Phone</a> device. Alternatively, you can use a password management tool such as 1Password to generate these one-time codes. Then you need to click &ldquo;<a href="https://awardwallet.com/user/edit.php">Setup</a>&rdquo; under the Two-factor Authentication heading in your <a href="https://awardwallet.com/user/edit.php">AwardWallet profile</a>. After that you will see a special QR code that needs to be scanned by the Google Authenticator app (or by the password management app) to set it up:<br />
