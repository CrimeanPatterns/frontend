            <h1>AwardWallet Email Parsing API</h1>
            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Email Parsing API allows you to extract structured information from an unstructured email. Specifically, you can extract travel itineraries from virtually any travel provider using this REST API. The email parser API can automatically process incoming emails, it will extract data from incoming emails and using webhook integrations send the resulting structured data to your endpoint. The main benefit of this email scraping technology is that you can import travel reservations that belong to your users regardless of how these reservations were booked.</p>
<p>Technically here is what happens under the hood: when an email is received for parsing it gets put into a queue for processing, email workers grab emails out of that queue and send them for parsing. The actual process of parsing consists of applying tens of thousands of regular expressions against a given email until the right parser is found and the required data attributes are extracted from that email. Some of our clients have asked us: &quot;What is the difference between email parsing and email scraping?&quot; and the answer is: there is no difference, email scraping (or parsing), just like web scraping means retrieving structured format from unstructured text, be that a web page or body of an email. There are usually two ways to do that: (1) to run regular expressions against that body of text or (2) run XPath queries if the text body has proper HTML formatting. </p>
<p>With AwardWallet Email Parsing API you can send any travel itinerary or reservation to our endpoint and the parse API will extract the data and return the reservation data in a structured format (JSON) for your consumption. Parsing is done automatically and takes just a few seconds.</p>
<p>We support thousands of email formats (<a href="https://awardwallet.com/supportedEmail">click to view the AwardWallet’s list of emails supported for parsing</a>) and we have a dedicated team of developers who constantly work on improving the API by adding new parsers to support new email formats.</p>
<p>If you have an email reservation and want to do a quick test you can upload the .eml file or copy-paste the raw content of the email via our <a href="https://awardwallet.com/emailTestParse">example test page</a>. You should see the parsing results immediately after submitting the request at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>For production mode, the API is designed to work asynchronously. Here is the workflow diagram explaining what happens to an email once it is received by the API:</p>
<div class="diagram-container"><div class="diagram"></div></div>
<p>At a high level, here is how the API works: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You submit an email message for parsing, and specify your <code>callbackUrl</code> (must be registered with us prior to using the API) in your request. Our API will respond with a <code>queued</code> status. At this point you don’t know if your message was parsed or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your message will be processed by an automated parser. Shortly, typically within seconds, you will receive a response to your <code>callbackUrl</code>, with one of the <a href="#method-email_Parsing_2"><code>status</code></a> codes (which are described below). In most cases, you should get a <code>success</code> code and the results of the parsing will be returned to you in that callback response. For testing, instead of receiving the results to your callback URL, you may simply call the <a href="#method-email_Parsing_2"><code>/getResults/{requestID}</code></a> method to see the results. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you get a <code>review</code> status - you should expect a subsequent callback with either <code>success</code>, <code>invalid</code>, <code>restricted</code> or <code>skipped</code> status. At this point we are not able to guarantee any time range for manual review process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typically, the emails that you send to us are stored on the AwardWallet’s servers for two weeks (in the Amazon AWS cloud). After that, the emails are permanently deleted from our servers. If it so happens that there will be emails in the <code>review</code> status at the two-week mark we will also send you a response to your <code>callbackUrl</code> with a status of <code>timeout</code> at the time when we purge the emails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every method that we make available as part of this API can be invoked through two endpoints, the ones that have the <code>-eu</code> in the URL point to our EU infrastructure, where all the data processing happens inside EU. The other one points to the servers hosted in the US.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You could use <a href="https://email.awardwallet.com/email/swagger.json">swagger schema</a> to generate your API clients.</p>

</ul>

                </pre>
                <p>Every API call needs to be authenticated with an API authentication token. This token is passed in the &quot;X-Authentication&quot; field with the https request header. The token is formed by concatenating the API username and API password with a &quot;:&quot; symbol. You need to <a href="https://awardwallet.com/contact">contact us</a> to get your API credentials.</p>

                                    <td><p>All callback URLs must be registered with us before use. For production deployments, this is the recommended way to work with our API. So the idea is – you send us a travel confirmation email to be parsed we send you the response as soon as we have it to the callback URL that was sent with the request. We will use http / basic authentication to authenticate ourselves. So when setting up your callback URLs with us, you also need to provide a username (i.e. awardwallet) and a password that we will use to authenticate ourselves when sending callbacks to that URL. We do not need the full path to your endpoint; we do not need the protocol or the port number; all we need is the domain. If your callback URL is <code>https://api.mydomain.com:8080/path/to/my/endpoint</code>, we would only need to register <code>api.mydomain.com</code>. We also support wildcards, so if you have multiple subdomains, we could register <code>*.mydomain.com</code>. We will send headers that look as follows with our callbacks:</p>
<p>Content-type: 'application/json'<br/>
Authorization: 'Basic YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI='</p>
<p>where <code>YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI=</code> is a base64 encoded string of the username and password separated by a colon, i.e. <code>awardwallet:password</code></p>
<p>When we send our callbacks to your endpoint, we are expecting a successful response code 2xx. The response body itself can be empty as long as we get code 2xx.</p>
<p>If we get anything other than code 2xx, we will keep trying to send you the response six more times. These retries will happen with the following waiting intervals: 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours and 12 hours between consecutive callback requests until we get a successful response code 2xx.</p>
<p>If the last callback attempt (which will happen approximately 22 hours after the initial callback request) fails to receive a response code 2xx, we will stop trying to send you the data. After that, you can still get the results by calling the <a href="#method-email_Parsing_2"><code>/getResults/</code></a> method using a <code>requestId</code> attribute.</p></td>

<p><strong>review</strong> - The automated parsers failed to parse this email, at this point the message is going to be placed into the manual queue for someone at AwardWallet to check it and decide if we should adjust a parser and re-run it again through the parsing process.

<p><strong>timeout</strong> - We were not able to review this email in a timely fashion, thus we don’t know if this is a valid reservation or not. This email was purged from our queue automatically and was not counted against your license count.</p></td>

                    <p>In addition to travel itineraries, we are able to retrieve loyalty information, such as loyalty account balance, elite status and expiration by parsing data out of email account statements for a select number of loyalty programs. All of the programs that we support and the properties we are able to retrieve are listed using this method.</p>
<aside class="notice">
    Please note that AwardWallet supports different providers under different APIs, for instance, the ListProviders method under our Web Parsing API will return a different list of providers.

                    <p>We support scanning mailboxes via 4 different methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>IMAP Protocol</li>
<li>Google API</li>
<li>Microsoft API</li>
<li>Yahoo API</li>
<li>Aol API</li>
</ul>
<p>Since both Google and Microsoft APIs support custom domains (for businesses) you can’t easily tell if a specific email address is managed by either Google Apps or Microsoft Office 365 cloud services. This call will perform the necessary queries to determine if this mailbox is managed by either Google or Microsoft. If it is not, then you need to connect this type of mailbox via the IMAP protocol.</p>

So the idea is – you send us a travel confirmation email to be parsed we send you the response as soon as we have it to the callback URL that was sent with the request. We will use http / basic authentication to authenticate ourselves. So when setting up your callback URLs with us, you also need to provide a username (i.e. awardwallet) and a password that we will use to authenticate ourselves when sending callbacks to that URL. We do not need the full path to your endpoint; we do not need the protocol or the port number; all we need is the domain. If your callback URL is <code>https://api.mydomain.com:8080/path/to/my/endpoint</code>, we would only need to register <code>api.mydomain.com</code>. We also support wildcards, so if you have multiple subdomains, we could register <code>*.mydomain.com</code>. We will send headers that look as follows with our callbacks:</p>
<p>Content-type: 'application/json'<br/>
Authorization: 'Basic YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI='</p>

<p>If the last callback attempt (which will happen approximately 22 hours after the initial callback request) fails to receive a response code 2xx, we will stop trying to send you the data.

So the idea is – you send us a travel confirmation email to be parsed we send you the response as soon as we have it to the callback URL that was sent with the request. We will use http / basic authentication to authenticate ourselves. So when setting up your callback URLs with us, you also need to provide a username (i.e. awardwallet) and a password that we will use to authenticate ourselves when sending callbacks to that URL. We do not need the full path to your endpoint; we do not need the protocol or the port number; all we need is the domain. If your callback URL is <code>https://api.mydomain.com:8080/path/to/my/endpoint</code>, we would only need to register <code>api.mydomain.com</code>. We also support wildcards, so if you have multiple subdomains, we could register <code>*.mydomain.com</code>. We will send headers that look as follows with our callbacks:</p>
<p>Content-type: 'application/json'<br/>
Authorization: 'Basic YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI='</p>
<p>where <code>YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI=</code> is a base64 encoded string of the username and password separated by a colon, i.e. <code>awardwallet:password</code></p>
<p>When we send our callbacks to your endpoint, we are expecting a successful response code 2xx. The response body itself can be empty as long as we get code 2xx.</p>
<p>If we get anything other than code 2xx, we will keep trying to send you the response six more times. These retries will happen with the following waiting intervals: 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours and 12 hours between consecutive callback requests until we get a successful response code 2xx.</p>
<p>If the last callback attempt (which will happen approximately 22 hours after the initial callback request) fails to receive a response code 2xx, we will stop trying to send you the data. After that, you can still get the results by calling the <a href="#method-email_Parsing_2"><code>/getResults/</code></a> method using a <code>requestId</code> attribute.</p></td>

<p>All callback URLs must be registered with us before use. For production deployments, this is the recommended way to work with our API. So the idea is – you send us a travel confirmation email to be parsed we send you the response as soon as we have it to the callback URL that was sent with the request. We will use http / basic authentication to authenticate ourselves.

                    <p>This method should be used to connect any Google mailbox, not just the <code>@gmail.com</code> mailboxes but also any mailboxes hosted by Google Apps. In case you are unsure if a given mailbox is hosted by Google you can call the <a href="#method-email_scanner_1"><code>/mailboxes/detect-type/{email}</code></a> method.</p>
<aside class="notice">
  Using this method to add a Google mailbox is optional. Alternatively you can just use the /mailboxes/start-auth along with the /mailboxes/auth/{code} methods to add a Google mailbox for scanning to our API.
</aside>
<p>This method utilizes native Google API to connect to the mailbox. The end user will get a message requesting access to his or her mailbox which looks like this:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>If you don’t want to have AwardWallet mentioned in this message to the end user, you need to <a href="https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/7454865">create and verify your own app with Google API</a> this way you will get your own <code>googleClientId</code>, <code>googleClientSecret</code>, and <code>googlePubSubTopic</code>. You need to provide those values to our support so that we can have your account updated. </p>
<p>Here are the rough steps that you need to take to create your own verified Google app:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Go to the Google Cloud Dashboard: <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard">https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard</a> and create a new project if you don’t already have one:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notice">
            You should pay close attention to the account you are using while doing all of this. Migrating projects from one account to another at a later time turned out to be a laborious task for us.
</aside>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Under the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard">API dashboard</a> you need to enable the <em>Gmail API</em>:</p>
</li>
<li style="list-style: none; text-align: center;">
<img class="preview" src="/assets/awardwalletnewdesign/img/api/email/screenshots/02_enableAPI.png">
</li>
<li>
<p>Next you need to <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/wizard?api=gmail.googleapis.com">create API credentials</a> to be used with this API:</p>
</li>
<li style="list-style: none; text-align: center;">

<img class="preview" src="/assets/awardwalletnewdesign/img/api/email/screenshots/03_CreateAPICredentials4.png">
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can send this client_id.json to our support or just send us the client_id and the client_secret </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Next you need to <a href="https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/7454865">verify the app you just created</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you met the prerequisites outlined in the article mentioned above you are ready to submit the <a href="https://support.google.com/code/contact/oauth_app_verification">OAuth Developer Verification Form</a></p>
</li>
<li style="list-style: none; text-align: center;">
<img class="preview" src="/assets/awardwalletnewdesign/img/api/email/screenshots/05_DeveloperVerificationForm.png">

</ul>
<aside class="notice">
   For the application scope you should request: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly

<p>Then you need to enable the Pub/Sub API as follows:</p>
</li>
<li style="list-style: none; text-align: center;">
<img class="preview" src="/assets/awardwalletnewdesign/img/api/email/screenshots/06_EnablePubSubAPI.png">
</li>
<li>
<p>Once it has been enabled you need to <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topicList">create a Pub/Sub Topic</a>. You should also review the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/quickstart-console">Google’s documentation</a> on this subject matter:</p>

<p>If you have not yet verified your domain, you would need to do that:</p>

<li style="list-style: none; text-align: center;">
<img class="preview" src="/assets/awardwalletnewdesign/img/api/email/screenshots/09_DomainVerification3.png">
</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to verify the domain would be to do it via the CNAME records:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none; text-align: center;">
<img class="preview" src="/assets/awardwalletnewdesign/img/api/email/screenshots/09_DomainVerification4.png">
</li>
</ul>
<p>You would need to give us the CNAME records to add:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none; text-align: center;">
<img class="preview" src="/assets/awardwalletnewdesign/img/api/email/screenshots/09_DomainVerification5.png">
</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notice">
Alternatively, you can set this up on your domain (i.e. emailscanner.yourdomain.com) and then point your domain to us via CNAME. In either case AwardWallet support needs to be contacted to set this up
 </aside>
<p>Once set up, you should verify your domain ownership and you should get a confirmation from Google that it worked:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none; text-align: center;">
<img class="preview" src="/assets/awardwalletnewdesign/img/api/email/screenshots/09_DomainVerification6.png">
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of it you should see at least one Pub/Sub topic subscription enabled:</p>
</li>
<li style="list-style: none; text-align: center;">
<img class="preview" src="/assets/awardwalletnewdesign/img/api/email/screenshots/10_PubSubTopicsSubscription.png">
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, you need to set up Pub/Sub Topic permissions:</p>
</li>
<li style="list-style: none; text-align: center;">
<img class="preview" src="/assets/awardwalletnewdesign/img/api/email/screenshots/11_PubSubTopicsSubscriptionPermissions1.png">
</li>
</ul>
<p>Make the <code>gmail-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com</code> account Pub/Sub Publisher:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none; text-align: center;">
<img class="preview" src="/assets/awardwalletnewdesign/img/api/email/screenshots/11_PubSubTopicsSubscriptionPermissions2.png">
</li>
</ul>
<p>here is what it should look like:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none; text-align: center;">
<img class="preview" src="/assets/awardwalletnewdesign/img/api/email/screenshots/11_PubSubTopicsSubscriptionPermissions3.png">
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is it, after you finish these steps you should be all set to get access to Gmail accounts.</p>

                                    <td><p>All callback URLs must be registered with us before use. For production deployments, this is the recommended way to work with our API. So the idea is – you send us a travel confirmation email to be parsed we send you the response as soon as we have it to the callback URL that was sent with the request. We will use http / basic authentication to authenticate ourselves. So when setting up your callback URLs with us, you also need to provide a username (i.e. awardwallet) and a password that we will use to authenticate ourselves when sending callbacks to that URL. We do not need the full path to your endpoint; we do not need the protocol or the port number; all we need is the domain. If your callback URL is <code>https://api.mydomain.com:8080/path/to/my/endpoint</code>, we would only need to register <code>api.mydomain.com</code>. We also support wildcards, so if you have multiple subdomains, we could register <code>*.mydomain.com</code>. We will send headers that look as follows with our callbacks:</p>
<p>Content-type: 'application/json'<br/>
Authorization: 'Basic YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI='</p>
<p>where <code>YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI=</code> is a base64 encoded string of the username and password separated by a colon, i.e. <code>awardwallet:password</code></p>
<p>When we send our callbacks to your endpoint, we are expecting a successful response code 2xx. The response body itself can be empty as long as we get code 2xx.</p>
<p>If we get anything other than code 2xx, we will keep trying to send you the response six more times. These retries will happen with the following waiting intervals: 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours and 12 hours between consecutive callback requests until we get a successful response code 2xx.</p>
<p>If the last callback attempt (which will happen approximately 22 hours after the initial callback request) fails to receive a response code 2xx, we will stop trying to send you the data. After that, you can still get the results by calling the <a href="#method-email_Parsing_2"><code>/getResults/</code></a> method using a <code>requestId</code> attribute.</p></td>

So the idea is – you send us a travel confirmation email to be parsed we send you the response as soon as we have it to the callback URL that was sent with the request. We will use http / basic authentication to authenticate ourselves. So when setting up your callback URLs with us, you also need to provide a username (i.e. awardwallet) and a password that we will use to authenticate ourselves when sending callbacks to that URL. We do not need the full path to your endpoint; we do not need the protocol or the port number; all we need is the domain. If your callback URL is <code>https://api.mydomain.com:8080/path/to/my/endpoint</code>, we would only need to register <code>api.mydomain.com</code>. We also support wildcards, so if you have multiple subdomains, we could register <code>*.mydomain.com</code>. We will send headers that look as follows with our callbacks:</p>
<p>Content-type: 'application/json'<br/>
Authorization: 'Basic YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI='</p>
<p>where <code>YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI=</code> is a base64 encoded string of the username and password separated by a colon, i.e. <code>awardwallet:password</code></p>
<p>When we send our callbacks to your endpoint, we are expecting a successful response code 2xx. The response body itself can be empty as long as we get code 2xx.</p>
<p>If we get anything other than code 2xx, we will keep trying to send you the response six more times. These retries will happen with the following waiting intervals: 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours and 12 hours between consecutive callback requests until we get a successful response code 2xx.</p>
<p>If the last callback attempt (which will happen approximately 22 hours after the initial callback request) fails to receive a response code 2xx, we will stop trying to send you the data. After that, you can still get the results by calling the <a href="#method-email_Parsing_2"><code>/getResults/</code></a> method using a <code>requestId</code> attribute.</p></td>

<img class="preview" src="/assets/awardwalletnewdesign/img/api/email/screenshots/02_MS_GenerateNewPassword.png">
</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you safely copy the password, you will need to provide this password to our support in order to allow us to scan your user’s mailboxes:</p>

</ul>
<p>Then, you need to add a platform, you should select “Web” as the platform:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>For the Redirect URLs, you should put <code>https://service.awardwallet.com/email/v2/mailboxes/auth/callback</code> we will handle the response to update this mailbox connection and then will redirect the user to the <code>redirectUrl</code> that you specified in the <code>/mailboxes/start-auth</code> request. You can set the logout URL to be whatever you like on your domain. If you don’t wish to have AwardWallet listed in the Redirect URL you can set that to be your domain, i.e. <a href="https://yourdoamin.com/email/callback">https://yourdoamin.com/email/callback</a> and then proxy requests sent to this URL to our callback URL. In the end your settings should looks something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none; text-align: center;">

                                    <td><p>All callback URLs must be registered with us before use. For production deployments, this is the recommended way to work with our API. So the idea is – you send us a travel confirmation email to be parsed we send you the response as soon as we have it to the callback URL that was sent with the request. We will use http / basic authentication to authenticate ourselves. So when setting up your callback URLs with us, you also need to provide a username (i.e. awardwallet) and a password that we will use to authenticate ourselves when sending callbacks to that URL. We do not need the full path to your endpoint; we do not need the protocol or the port number; all we need is the domain. If your callback URL is <code>https://api.mydomain.com:8080/path/to/my/endpoint</code>, we would only need to register <code>api.mydomain.com</code>. We also support wildcards, so if you have multiple subdomains, we could register <code>*.mydomain.com</code>. We will send headers that look as follows with our callbacks:</p>
<p>Content-type: 'application/json'<br/>
Authorization: 'Basic YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI='</p>
<p>where <code>YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI=</code> is a base64 encoded string of the username and password separated by a colon, i.e. <code>awardwallet:password</code></p>
<p>When we send our callbacks to your endpoint, we are expecting a successful response code 2xx. The response body itself can be empty as long as we get code 2xx.</p>
<p>If we get anything other than code 2xx, we will keep trying to send you the response six more times. These retries will happen with the following waiting intervals: 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours and 12 hours between consecutive callback requests until we get a successful response code 2xx.</p>
<p>If the last callback attempt (which will happen approximately 22 hours after the initial callback request) fails to receive a response code 2xx, we will stop trying to send you the data. After that, you can still get the results by calling the <a href="#method-email_Parsing_2"><code>/getResults/</code></a> method using a <code>requestId</code> attribute.</p></td>

So the idea is – you send us a travel confirmation email to be parsed we send you the response as soon as we have it to the callback URL that was sent with the request. We will use http / basic authentication to authenticate ourselves. So when setting up your callback URLs with us, you also need to provide a username (i.e. awardwallet) and a password that we will use to authenticate ourselves when sending callbacks to that URL. We do not need the full path to your endpoint; we do not need the protocol or the port number; all we need is the domain. If your callback URL is <code>https://api.mydomain.com:8080/path/to/my/endpoint</code>, we would only need to register <code>api.mydomain.com</code>. We also support wildcards, so if you have multiple subdomains, we could register <code>*.mydomain.com</code>. We will send headers that look as follows with our callbacks:</p>
<p>Content-type: 'application/json'<br/>
Authorization: 'Basic YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI='</p>
<p>where <code>YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI=</code> is a base64 encoded string of the username and password separated by a colon, i.e. <code>awardwallet:password</code></p>
<p>When we send our callbacks to your endpoint, we are expecting a successful response code 2xx. The response body itself can be empty as long as we get code 2xx.</p>
<p>If we get anything other than code 2xx, we will keep trying to send you the response six more times. These retries will happen with the following waiting intervals: 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours and 12 hours between consecutive callback requests until we get a successful response code 2xx.</p>
<p>If the last callback attempt (which will happen approximately 22 hours after the initial callback request) fails to receive a response code 2xx, we will stop trying to send you the data. After that, you can still get the results by calling the <a href="#method-email_Parsing_2"><code>/getResults/</code></a> method using a <code>requestId</code> attribute.</p></td>

So the idea is – you send us a travel confirmation email to be parsed we send you the response as soon as we have it to the callback URL that was sent with the request. We will use http / basic authentication to authenticate ourselves. So when setting up your callback URLs with us, you also need to provide a username (i.e. awardwallet) and a password that we will use to authenticate ourselves when sending callbacks to that URL. We do not need the full path to your endpoint; we do not need the protocol or the port number; all we need is the domain. If your callback URL is <code>https://api.mydomain.com:8080/path/to/my/endpoint</code>, we would only need to register <code>api.mydomain.com</code>. We also support wildcards, so if you have multiple subdomains, we could register <code>*.mydomain.com</code>. We will send headers that look as follows with our callbacks:</p>
<p>Content-type: 'application/json'<br/>
Authorization: 'Basic YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI='</p>
<p>where <code>YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI=</code> is a base64 encoded string of the username and password separated by a colon, i.e. <code>awardwallet:password</code></p>
<p>When we send our callbacks to your endpoint, we are expecting a successful response code 2xx. The response body itself can be empty as long as we get code 2xx.</p>
<p>If we get anything other than code 2xx, we will keep trying to send you the response six more times. These retries will happen with the following waiting intervals: 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours and 12 hours between consecutive callback requests until we get a successful response code 2xx.</p>
<p>If the last callback attempt (which will happen approximately 22 hours after the initial callback request) fails to receive a response code 2xx, we will stop trying to send you the data. After that, you can still get the results by calling the <a href="#method-email_Parsing_2"><code>/getResults/</code></a> method using a <code>requestId</code> attribute.</p></td>

So the idea is – you send us a travel confirmation email to be parsed we send you the response as soon as we have it to the callback URL that was sent with the request. We will use http / basic authentication to authenticate ourselves. So when setting up your callback URLs with us, you also need to provide a username (i.e. awardwallet) and a password that we will use to authenticate ourselves when sending callbacks to that URL. We do not need the full path to your endpoint; we do not need the protocol or the port number; all we need is the domain. If your callback URL is <code>https://api.mydomain.com:8080/path/to/my/endpoint</code>, we would only need to register <code>api.mydomain.com</code>. We also support wildcards, so if you have multiple subdomains, we could register <code>*.mydomain.com</code>. We will send headers that look as follows with our callbacks:</p>
<p>Content-type: 'application/json'<br/>
Authorization: 'Basic YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI='</p>
<p>where <code>YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI=</code> is a base64 encoded string of the username and password separated by a colon, i.e. <code>awardwallet:password</code></p>
<p>When we send our callbacks to your endpoint, we are expecting a successful response code 2xx. The response body itself can be empty as long as we get code 2xx.</p>
<p>If we get anything other than code 2xx, we will keep trying to send you the response six more times. These retries will happen with the following waiting intervals: 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours and 12 hours between consecutive callback requests until we get a successful response code 2xx.</p>
<p>If the last callback attempt (which will happen approximately 22 hours after the initial callback request) fails to receive a response code 2xx, we will stop trying to send you the data. After that, you can still get the results by calling the <a href="#method-email_Parsing_2"><code>/getResults/</code></a> method using a <code>requestId</code> attribute.</p></td>

                                    <td><p>All callback URLs must be registered with us before use. For production deployments, this is the recommended way to work with our API. So the idea is – you send us a travel confirmation email to be parsed we send you the response as soon as we have it to the callback URL that was sent with the request. We will use http / basic authentication to authenticate ourselves. So when setting up your callback URLs with us, you also need to provide a username (i.e. awardwallet) and a password that we will use to authenticate ourselves when sending callbacks to that URL. We do not need the full path to your endpoint; we do not need the protocol or the port number; all we need is the domain. If your callback URL is <code>https://api.mydomain.com:8080/path/to/my/endpoint</code>, we would only need to register <code>api.mydomain.com</code>. We also support wildcards, so if you have multiple subdomains, we could register <code>*.mydomain.com</code>. We will send headers that look as follows with our callbacks:</p>
<p>Content-type: 'application/json'<br/>
Authorization: 'Basic YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI='</p>
<p>where <code>YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI=</code> is a base64 encoded string of the username and password separated by a colon, i.e. <code>awardwallet:password</code></p>
<p>When we send our callbacks to your endpoint, we are expecting a successful response code 2xx. The response body itself can be empty as long as we get code 2xx.</p>
<p>If we get anything other than code 2xx, we will keep trying to send you the response six more times. These retries will happen with the following waiting intervals: 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours and 12 hours between consecutive callback requests until we get a successful response code 2xx.</p>
<p>If the last callback attempt (which will happen approximately 22 hours after the initial callback request) fails to receive a response code 2xx, we will stop trying to send you the data. After that, you can still get the results by calling the <a href="#method-email_Parsing_2"><code>/getResults/</code></a> method using a <code>requestId</code> attribute.</p></td>

So the idea is – you send us a travel confirmation email to be parsed we send you the response as soon as we have it to the callback URL that was sent with the request. We will use http / basic authentication to authenticate ourselves. So when setting up your callback URLs with us, you also need to provide a username (i.e. awardwallet) and a password that we will use to authenticate ourselves when sending callbacks to that URL. We do not need the full path to your endpoint; we do not need the protocol or the port number; all we need is the domain. If your callback URL is <code>https://api.mydomain.com:8080/path/to/my/endpoint</code>, we would only need to register <code>api.mydomain.com</code>. We also support wildcards, so if you have multiple subdomains, we could register <code>*.mydomain.com</code>. We will send headers that look as follows with our callbacks:</p>
<p>Content-type: 'application/json'<br/>
Authorization: 'Basic YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI='</p>
<p>where <code>YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI=</code> is a base64 encoded string of the username and password separated by a colon, i.e. <code>awardwallet:password</code></p>
<p>When we send our callbacks to your endpoint, we are expecting a successful response code 2xx. The response body itself can be empty as long as we get code 2xx.</p>
<p>If we get anything other than code 2xx, we will keep trying to send you the response six more times. These retries will happen with the following waiting intervals: 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours and 12 hours between consecutive callback requests until we get a successful response code 2xx.</p>
<p>If the last callback attempt (which will happen approximately 22 hours after the initial callback request) fails to receive a response code 2xx, we will stop trying to send you the data. After that, you can still get the results by calling the <a href="#method-email_Parsing_2"><code>/getResults/</code></a> method using a <code>requestId</code> attribute.</p></td>

We will use http / basic authentication to authenticate ourselves. So when setting up your callback URLs with us, you also need to provide a username (i.e. awardwallet) and a password that we will use to authenticate ourselves when sending callbacks to that URL. We do not need the full path to your endpoint; we do not need the protocol or the port number; all we need is the domain. If your callback URL is <code>https://api.mydomain.com:8080/path/to/my/endpoint</code>, we would only need to register <code>api.mydomain.com</code>. We also support wildcards, so if you have multiple subdomains, we could register <code>*.mydomain.com</code>. We will send headers that look as follows with our callbacks:</p>

So the idea is – you send us a travel confirmation email to be parsed we send you the response as soon as we have it to the callback URL that was sent with the request. We will use http / basic authentication to authenticate ourselves. So when setting up your callback URLs with us, you also need to provide a username (i.e. awardwallet) and a password that we will use to authenticate ourselves when sending callbacks to that URL. We do not need the full path to your endpoint; we do not need the protocol or the port number; all we need is the domain. If your callback URL is <code>https://api.mydomain.com:8080/path/to/my/endpoint</code>, we would only need to register <code>api.mydomain.com</code>. We also support wildcards, so if you have multiple subdomains, we could register <code>*.mydomain.com</code>. We will send headers that look as follows with our callbacks:</p>
<p>Content-type: 'application/json'<br/>
Authorization: 'Basic YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI='</p>
<p>where <code>YXdhcmR3YWxsZXQ6YXdkZXZlbG9wZXI=</code> is a base64 encoded string of the username and password separated by a colon, i.e. <code>awardwallet:password</code></p>
<p>When we send our callbacks to your endpoint, we are expecting a successful response code 2xx. The response body itself can be empty as long as we get code 2xx.</p>
<p>If we get anything other than code 2xx, we will keep trying to send you the response six more times. These retries will happen with the following waiting intervals: 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours and 12 hours between consecutive callback requests until we get a successful response code 2xx.</p>
<p>If the last callback attempt (which will happen approximately 22 hours after the initial callback request) fails to receive a response code 2xx, we will stop trying to send you the data. After that, you can still get the results by calling the <a href="#method-email_Parsing_2"><code>/getResults/</code></a> method using a <code>requestId</code> attribute.</p></td>

                    <p>List all the mailboxes you have aded to the scanner. You can filter the results by tags.
To do that, Separate the tags by comma &quot;,&quot;, for example:</p>
<p><code class="prettyprint">GET /json/v2/mailboxes/scroll/?tags=tag1,tag2</code></p>
<p>This will return all the mailboxes that have both tag1 and tag2.</p>
<p>If you have many connected mailboxes (hundreds or thousands), you should be using this method to list them. On your first call, you would request this method without the <code>pageToken</code> attribute, but on the consequent requests, to fetch the next page, you need to pass the <code>nextPageToken</code> from the response body of your previous request. When you stop receiving the <code>nextPageToken</code>, it means that there are no more records to fetch.</p>
