        No charges were reported to your Miles and More account ending in %bold_on%%login%%bold_off% for the month of %date%. This could be because of a known bug in the reporting where charges during a calendar month are not reported properly or because you made no charges that month. M&M rules require you to make a charge every month. Missing even one month means your miles are at risk of expiring starting 36 months from when they were earned. If you believe you did make a charge during %date% you should contact M&M to have them examine your account.

        You also may want to go to the M&M forum on Flyertalk for more information about this issue and options if you failed to make the required monthly charge of at least $1 or had credits to your account in excess of your charges.
