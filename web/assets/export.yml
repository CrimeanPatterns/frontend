  title: AwardWallet Account Access API
  description: |
    The AwardWallet Account Access API provides access to the loyalty account data that belongs to AwardWallet users. Once authorized by the end user, the API provides access to the loyalty accounts that the user shared with you.

    To use this API you need to have a business account, which can be registered [here](https://awardwallet.com/user/create-business-account), if you already have a personal AwardWallet account, or [here](https://business.awardwallet.com/#/registerBusiness) if you don’t have a personal AwardWallet account.

    Your API key and other API settings can be found under your [business account](https://business.awardwallet.com/profile/api).

    This API will allow you to retrieve information about any of the users that linked their accounts to your business account. You don’t need to have a paid business account in order to use the API. However, if you need a nice UI interface to see all of the users who shared their loyalty accounts with your business, you can use our business interface to do that.

    If you wish to be able to invite users to link their accounts to your business interface you need to [request that form the AwardWallet team](https://awardwallet.com/contact) by sending a description of your business and intended use case.

    Once approved by AwardWallet you could start inviting users by using [create-auth-url](#method-Connect_1) method.

    Finally, you can have two types of members under your business interface&#58;
    - **Connected Users** – these are the users who have their own personal AwardWallet credentials who chose to connect their accounts to your business account. They can choose granularly what exactly they wish to share with you.
    - **Members** – basically these are just names you add under your business interface. They make your life easier when organizing stuff under your business interface. These members don’t have an AwardWallet account and therefore are not linked to you the same way as Connected Users are.

    Since these two entities are quite different you need to use two different API calls to get info about them.

      Every API call needs to be authenticated with an API key. This key is passed in the "X-Authentication" field with the https request header. You can get your personal API key in the [account settings of your business account](https://business.awardwallet.com/profile/api).

                  There are two possible values:
                  	- `mobile` - use this if you are planning to show the concent screen on the mobile device. Also,
                  	even if you are showing it on a desktop using the mobile interface may work better for you, so you should consider using this option regardless of where the consent screen is shown.
                  	- `desktop` - this option will show the consent screen in a context of our standard full-blown desktop interface.

                  This attribute accepts values 0 – 3. It identifies the level of account access the User will be
                  prompted to grant to the business. The possible values are:

                    **0** - Read account numbers / usernames and elite statuses only

                    **1** - Read account balances and elite statuses only

                    **2** - Read all information excluding passwords

                    **3** - Full control (edit, delete, auto-login, view passwords)

                  First of all this option (if set to `true`) only works with if you also set the platform to `desktop`. By default this attribute is set to `false`, if set to `true` users will be given a link that allows them to go into their AwardWallet profile and granularly select which accounts they wish to share via the full-blown AwardWallet desktop interface.
